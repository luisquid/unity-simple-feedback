# Simple Feedback Form for Unity
As the title states, this is a simple feedback form that you can implement to gather in-game feedback of your game or application. This uses Google Forms as a way to receive feedback, so it requires some setup on Google Forms. 

## Installation Steps:
1. Download the package to your project.
2. In the Simple Feedback Form folder you will find the Simple Feedback Form prefab. Drag it to the first scene of your game. 

## Setup Steps

## Disclaimer
This package is provided as is and no support will be given to it. Feel free to fork it and adapt it to your needs. The supported Unity versions and Platforms are limited to the ones I was able to test on my own. That does not mean that it won't work in other versions/platforms, but I can't guarantee that it will.
